        <h2>Hello!</h2>
        <p>
          I am Souvik Nandi, Engineer by profession and science enthusiast by passion.
          <br />
          I was born in Kolkata (West Bengal, India) and currently travelling across the country to explore new
          dimensions of life.
          <br /><br />
          Well, I did spent around first 18 years of my life, following a life of a typical Indian student until I went
          to college to live an adventurous life, not missing a fun for a single second, meeting new people, exploring
          new places. Ohhh! I miss that life. Well that does not mean I have stopped exploring, I am becoming more
          stronger (only mentally, have already started to skip gym) and learning something new everyday.
          <br /><br />
          Well in a nutshell thats me, smiling through the tough phases and focused when things don't work out, I
          believe thats the beauty of life we eventualy reach our destination but the road is always unplanned.
